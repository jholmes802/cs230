CS230 Module Eight Journal

The Gaming Room 
A new and innovative company developing new game ideas and new ways to play. This company is looking to utilize new technology, architecture, and methods with their new applications. This software is a design for a new game, where teams of players watch an image render over time and have to guess what it is, otherwise, the remaining teams can submit a guess after the time is up. 

Documentation
When writing this documentation I focused on exploring technical options for the systems architecture, wether it should live on a Windows or Linux server. These technical decisions drive how the software is written and what method are available to the developer.

Working The Process
When writing the documentation as thoroughly as possible in the early stages it helps define certain functions and interactions in your code, making it easier to spread the work amongst multiple developers. It makes it easier to build each function because its input and outputs have been thought about more. 

Revisions
I would want to revisit the domain model section, now that I have worked more with the notations and UML design I think I could do a better job explaining the model. 

User's Needs
Understanding the user's needs are important when creating the documentation, going just by how you think a program should be used does not mean the user will use it that way. As well as thinking about what things a user will want when interacting with the program, from a clean and easy-to-access interface.

Software Design
When designing software I like to get a list of requirements together so I can break those into functions and classes so they can be worked on and tested as it's developed. This will help ensure instead of developing and trying each system/method and splitting them out as I go, this gives me a plan on how to split those functions already.
